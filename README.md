This is an incomplete analysis on the factors surrounding the net migration from California to Montana in recent years. While the variables present
are relevant, there are better options (median HH income instead of minimum wage ratio) and other relevant factors (crime statistic differentials)
that could not be included due to a lack of current data.

When calculating the net immigrants from California, I used available data from the census and state filings to get a raw number. 
Starting with the annual population change in Montana, I subtracted the difference between the births and deaths from the total population change
to get a total population change from immigration. Then I looked at the net immigration between California and Montana and took the total
to get a percentage of net immigrants from California. This was then used to get the percentage of the total on a monthly basis.
